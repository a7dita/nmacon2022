** Abstract

The Stringer experiment [1, 2] records both the spontaneous neuronal activity of mice visual cortex and the population-level neuronal response during the orientation decoding task, and brings about several interesting observations. Whereas it successfully establishes differential tuning activities of V1 neurons, it does not provide an explanation of the observed spontaneous motor activity in the mice during the decoding task. We aim to investigate if the motor activity is related to the visual task in any possible way. Specifically, if the orientational preference of the neurons is correlated to the velocity of running and if the positional distribution of the neurons can be informative in this regard. Several studies report an enhancing role of locomotion in visual processing [3, 4], whereas V1 neurons show spatial location-related information encoding in another study [5]. However, another paper claims that locomotion in mice might result from the spontaneous activities of the motor cortex [6].

From our preliminary data analysis, we discover a subset of the neurons that showed bimodal tuning towards orientation grating, and a smaller subset of silent neurons, in addition to the well-known unimodally tuned neurons. Also, we are unable to establish any direct correlation between the orientation stimuli and the running speed (Pearson co-eff = - 0.035). We plan to design a suitable ML decoding algorithm to check if that can predict the running speed from any higher-order information encoded in the neuronal representation of the visual cortex. Logistic regression categorises movement from non-movement with 86.9% accuracy.  Following that, we build a GLM model to efficiently predict the velocity from neuronal activity. The results indicate that visual representation encodes sufficient information to predict the running speed. We plan to explore the role of individual neuronal positions and tunings (or absence of tunings) in determining the running speed. We also plan to explore other non-linear methods for better prediction.

* Possible Extentions

** DONE Find out the details of the mice PVC neocoortical layers.
** DONE Find out how the accuracy of our log-reg model varies with different cut-offs for rest/running

We do a for-loop over 0-20 range of running speed and find the accuracies of LR classification for each of them.
We plot the accuracies, and find a sharp rise of accuracy with a cut-off of 2, and no further increase of performance beyond that.
Therefore, we choose this particular cut-off for our further analysis.
** IN-PROGRESS Do cross-validation for our GLM

** TODO Try different dimensionality reduction techniques
** TODO Find out the clusters responsible for different neocortical layers
** TODO Build a network model for mice PVC

*** IN-PROGRESS [[id:9719bf17-c060-4796-beed-dc426911b0db][blumenfeld2006 - Neural network model of the primary visual cortex: From functional architecture to lateral connectivity and back]]

activity patterns similar to orientation maps (OMs), emerge in the primary visual cortex (V1) even in the absence of sensory input, suggesting an intrinsic mechanism of OM activation.

we suggest a neural network model in which OMs are encoded by the intrinsic lateral connections

The proposed connectivity pattern depends on the preferred orientation and, unlike previous models, on the degree of orientation selectivity of the interconnected neurons.

We prove that the network has a ring attractor composed of an approximated version of the OMs. Consequently, OMs emerge spontaneously when the network is presented with an unstructured noisy input.

*** TODO Try this V1 network model using PyNN
